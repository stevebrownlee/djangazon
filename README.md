## Helpful Resources

### Django Models and Migrations

Using the requirements above create a [model](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/topics/db/models/) for each resource, and use [migrations](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/topics/migrations/) to ensure your database structure is up to date.

### Templates

[Django template language](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/ref/templates/language/)

### Form Helpers

Django, like Angular, has many built-in [helper tags and filters](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/ref/templates/builtins/) when building the site templates. We strongly recommend reading this documentation while building your templates.
